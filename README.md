# What?

A simple tool that logins to an IMAP4 server and removes all messages older than a given number of days.

Inspired by https://gitlab.com/mikecardwell/IMAPExpire, but written in Python instead of Perl, and requiring nothing but the basic Python install.

# How to use?

Run

```
pyimapexpire --help
```
